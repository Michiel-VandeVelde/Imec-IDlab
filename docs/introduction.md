Hi there :wave:

I'm Michiel Van de Velde and starting on the 9th of February, I'll be an intern at **[IDLab](https://www.idlab.ugent.be/)**, a collaboration of Imec and Gent University. Where I'll be assisting a great team of researchers with all kinds of interesting projects.

You can read more about me or contact me directly via [My Website](https://michielvandevelde.com#home)
