> This lowers barriers for SMEs and creates faster links between ecosystems.”

### **Simpler EU digital rules and new digital wallets to save billions for businesses and boost innovation**

1. **Digital Omnibus**  
   simplifying rules on data, cyber and AI

2. **Data Union Strategy**  
   unlocking more high-quality data for AI

3. **EU Business Wallets**  
   cutting paperwork and easing regulatory burdens


**Impacts of the Data Union Strategy**

- Scales up access to high-quality data for AI

- Streamlines and simplifies data rules while protecting fundamental rights

- Protects Europe’s data sovereignty



## **What is Simpl?**

**Simpl is the open-source smart middleware**  
that enables **cloud-to-edge federations** and  
**all major data initiatives** funded by the **European Commission**

### **Simpl Essentials**

- **open-source** = built-in trust & security, flexibility to deploy, simplicity to customise

- **middleware** = software that lets applications and databases work seamlessly together


### **Cloud-to-edge federations**

Put together resources across cloud and edge computing environments as a cohesive system, creating a seamlessly integrated infrastructure that combines the strength of both cloud and edge computing.

### **All major data initiatives**

In particular the development of **Common European Data Spaces** in a modular and interoperable way.


## **Data space fundamentals influencing Simpl-Open**

### The data space context

- Data spaces are **data & service sharing ecosystems**

- Technology and contracts need to work hand-in-hand to enforce proper data sharing

- Simpl-Open brings new features that allow **stronger technology-based enforcement**


### Diagram meaning

- Participants (organisations) connect inside a **Data Space**

- A **Governance Authority** defines rules

- **Simpl-Open helps govern standards for interoperability**

- **Simpl-Open enables seamless interactions between participants**

## **Simpl-Open Architecture Principles**

**Key architecture principles**

- **Resilience**  
  Components must be fault-tolerant so failures have minimal impact

- **Federation**  
  Simpl-Open serves as a federation of data and infrastructure enabling interoperability and decentralisation

- **Modularity**  
  Architecture must be modular and use open-source technologies

- **Loose coupling**  
  Components should be loosely coupled to minimise dependencies

- **Openness & agnosticism**  
  Designed using open specifications and standards

- **Composability & extensibility**  
  Allows iterative growth and addition of new services

- **Interoperability**  
  All participants can interact and exchange data in a well-specified way

- **Scalability & elasticity**  
  Supports workload scaling and resource pooling

- **Security, privacy & trust**  
  Secure and compliant with regulations

- **Discoverability**  
  Services are publicly exposed and discoverable via registries
